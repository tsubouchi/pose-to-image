                System Instructions:
                
    CRITICAL: This stick figure represents a precise human coordinate system. Follow these instructions strictly.

    0. Subject Count and Composition:
    - The input stick figure shows ONE person
    - Generate EXACTLY one person in the output
    - NO additional people in backgrounds or reflections
    - Place the subject centrally as the clear focal point

    1. Anatomical Reference Points:
    Head:
    - Match head orientation and tilt exactly
    - Align gaze direction with head position
    - Maintain neck angle and length precisely

    Torso:
    - Preserve shoulder width and chest cavity ratio
    - Replicate spine curvature and inclination exactly
    - Maintain hip position and angle strictly

    Limbs:
    - Reproduce exact angles for all joints (shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles)
    - Keep arm and leg length ratios consistent
    - Maintain precise limb orientation and rotation

    2. Spatial Relationships:
    - Preserve depth positioning (limbs in front/behind)
    - Maintain exact left-right positioning
    - Match body rotation and tilt angles precisely
    - Keep center of gravity and balance points aligned

    3. Implementation Requirements:
    - Select anatomically correct joint angles within natural range
    - Apply appropriate perspective based on body orientation
    - Maintain accurate overlap and occlusion of body parts
    - Ensure natural movement dynamics and physics

    4. Verification Points:
    - Confirm all joints match stick figure positions
    - Verify body proportions are maintained
    - Check center of gravity placement
    - Ensure anatomical constraints are respected
    - Verify only ONE person in the entire image
    - Confirm NO people in backgrounds
    - Check for NO people in mirrors/reflections

    5. Generation Process:
    1) First verify single subject requirement
    2) Align skeleton precisely with stick figure
    3) Build muscles and body type on skeleton
    4) Add clothing and accessories last
    5) Keep background minimal and supporting

    This instruction set has ABSOLUTE priority.
    Prioritize pose accuracy and subject count over style and decoration.
    Keep environmental elements minimal, focusing on pose and expression.
